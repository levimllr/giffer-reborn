You can verify the serial output by looking at the Output Console tab in Giffer OR you can upload the code to an Arduino and look at the Serial Output by clicking on the Serial Monitor magnifying Glass in the Arduino IDE.\n    5. Now it is time to practice using **If / else statements** by making your program output the same serial monitor output as shown below. Note: Previously when we used Giffer to grade exercises we only had Giffer check the LED states. But now we are going to have Giffer check the LED states AND check the Serial Monitor Output. Your code needs to have the same serial monitor output as shown below, in the correct frames, for Giffer to recognize your code as correct. When Giffer says correct, it has checked your code for accuracy in both the LED states and the Serial Monitor Output. **HINT: Add one simple else statement in loop() to add the additional serial output at the correct time.** New serial output is **shown in bold below.**\n      1.
