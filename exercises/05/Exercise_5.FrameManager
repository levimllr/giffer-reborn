This creates a location in Arduino’s memory named “x” that is used to store an integer value. Integers can have values as small as -32,768 and as large as +32768.\n\nASIDE: Why use variables? Because variables allow our programs to be dynamic / flexible\n\nNEW: x = 1000;\n\nDESCRIPTION: Stores or puts “1000” in the “x” memory location.\n\nNEW: delay(x);\n\nDESCRIPTION: Tells Arduino to delay “x” milliseconds – where “x” is an integer value stored in the Arduino’s memory.\n\nACTIVITIES:\n\n1. Copy the program from Starting Point Exercise05 into the Arduino IDE. \n2. Compile and upload this program to the Arduino and verify that LED 2 turns ON for a 1 second and then OFF for 5 seconds and repeats over and over…. OR we can say that LED 2 BLINKS ON for 1 second and OFF for 5 seconds and repeats over and over…..\n3. Modify the program so that LED 2 BLINKS ON for 3 seconds and OFF for 5 seconds ….…\n4. Modify the program so that LED 2 BLINKS ON for 0.5 seconds and OFF for 5 seconds …...\n5. Modify the program so that the variable name is t instead of x.\n6. Save the completed sketch as YourInitials_Exercise05 in: Documents – Arduino – Exercises\n7. Copy the code into the Giffer website\n8. Enter your name and exercise number.\n9. Select the Run and Grade button.\n10. Look at the resulting Output image and make sure it is correct (Correct at lower part of image)\n11. If it is Correct - use the Copy Page button to copy the evidence that you have correctly completed the exercise to clipboard.\n12. Go to CL 10.3.05 Upload Completed Exercise05: And upload evidence that you have completed Exercise05\n13. Click \"Prepare an answer\" on NEO\n14. Click the \"<>\" (Source code) button.\n15. Paste by pressing CTRL + V\n16. Click \"Save and submit for grading\"\n17. If you made changes to the code in Giffer, then Copy the code from Giffer and paste it into the Arduino and re-save it as: YourInitials_Exercise05 - in your Documents/Arduino/Exercises Folder."}
