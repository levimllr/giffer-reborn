34:** Using more descriptive variable names in your function\ndefinitions to make your code easier to understand.\n\n**NEW:** **Using multiple function definitions, and function calls with better\nvariable names;**\n\n**EXAMPLE:** In the function definition blinkOnce below - you can see that the\ninteger t is used to control the delay time and the integer n is used to\ncontrol the LED that is turned on / off. This all works as expected.\n\n\n\nvoid blinkOnce(int t, int n)  \n{  \n digitalWrite(n, HIGH);  \n delay(t);  \n digitalWrite(n, LOW);  \n delay(t);  \n}\n\n\n\nHowever: If we instead use more descriptive variable names in the function\ndefinition the resulting code is much easier to read and understand.\n\n\n\nvoid blinkOnce(int delayTime, int ledNumber)  \n{  \n digitalWrite(ledNumber, HIGH);  \n delay(delayTime);  \n digitalWrite(ledNumber, LOW);  \n delay(delayTime);  \n}\n\nNow the variable names (delayTime and ledNumber) describe what the variables\nare used for, which makes the code easier to read and understand.\n\n\n\n**_ACTIVITIES:_**\n\n\n\n  1. When you finish this exercise there will be three custom functions. blinkOnce, blinkTwice and blinkInPairs.\n  2. Copy the program from Starting Point Exercise34 into the Arduino IDE\n  3. Create  a new function named blinkTwice, that like blinkOnce uses parameters to control the delay time and the LED to blink.\n  4. Create a new function named blinkInPairs.  The function blinkInPairs should blink two LEDs at the same time (turning on LEDs ledNumber   and ledNumber + 7) and like the other functions in this exercise, use uses parameters to control the delay time and the LED to blink.\n  5. Loop should have a for loop that repeats 5 times. Inside that for loop should be function calls to blinkOnce, blinkTwice and blinkInPairs. After the for loop repeats 5 times, there should be a delay of 4 seconds after which the whole thing starts over again.\n  6. Save the completed sketch as YourInitials_Exercise34 in: Documents – Arduino – Exercises\n  7. Copy the code into the Giffer website\n  8. Enter your name and exercise number.\n  9. Select the Run and Grade button.\n  10. Look at the resulting Output image and make sure it is correct (Correct at lower part of image)\n  11. If it is Correct - use the Copy Page button to copy the evidence that you have correctly completed the exercise to clipboard.\n  12. Go to CL 10.4.04 Upload Completed Exercise34: And upload evidence that you have completed Exercise34\n  13. Click \"Prepare an answer\" on NEO\n  14. Click the \"<>\" (Source code) button.\n  15. Paste by pressing CTRL + V\n  16. Click \"Save and submit for grading\"\n  17. If you made changes to the code in Giffer, then Copy the code from Giffer and paste it into the Arduino and re-save it as: YourInitials_Exercise34 - in your Documents/Arduino/Exercises Folder."}
