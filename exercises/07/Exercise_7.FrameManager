Turning on lots of LEDs – a somewhat tedious method.\n\nACTIVITIES:\n\n1. Copy the program from Starting Point Exercise07into the Arduino IDE. \n2. Compile and upload this program to the Arduino and verify that LED 2 turns ON for 100 milliseconds then OFF for 100 milliseconds and then LED 3, then LED 4, Then LED 5. Then waits for 5 seconds with all LEDs OFF and repeats over and over again.\n3. Modify the program so that LED 2 through LED 15 turn on and off with a 100 millisecond delay. Then waits for 5 seconds with all LEDs OFF and repeats over and over again.\n4. Save the completed sketch as YourInitials_Exercise07 in: Documents – Arduino – Exercises\n5. Copy the code into the Giffer website\n6. Enter your name and exercise number.\n7. Select the Run and Grade button.\n8. Look at the resulting Output image and make sure it is correct (Correct at lower part of image)\n9. If it is Correct - use theCopy Page button to copy the evidence that you have correctly completed the exercise to clipboard.\n10. Go to CL 10.3.07 Upload Completed Exercise07: And upload evidence that you have completed Exercise07\n11. Click \"Prepare an answer\" on NEO\n12. Click the \"<>\" (Source code) button.\n13. Paste by pressing CTRL + V\n14. Click \"Save and submit for grading\"\n15. If you made changes to the code in Giffer, then Copy the code from Giffer and paste it into the Arduino and re-save it as: YourInitials_Exercise07 - in your Documents/Arduino/Exercises Folder."}
