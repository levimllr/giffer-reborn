Copy the program from Starting Point Exercise03 into the Arduino IDE. \n2. Compile and upload this program to the Arduino and verify thatLED’s 2, 3, and 4  light up with a one second delay between each.\n3. Modify the program so the Arduino only delays 1/2 second between each LED.\n4. Modify the program so the Arduino only delays 1/4 second between each LED.\n5. Modify the  order the LEDs go on. New order LED 4, then LED 3, then LED 2.\n6. Save the completed sketch as YourInitials_Exercise03 in: Documents – Arduino – Exercises\n7. Copy the code into the Giffer website\n8. Enter your name and exercise number.\n9. Select the Run and Grade button.\n10. Look at the resulting Output image and make sure it is correct (Correct at lower part of image)\n11. If it is Correct -  use the Copy Page button to copy the evidence that you have correctly completed the exercise to clipboard.\n12. Go to CL 10.3.02 Upload Completed Exercise03:  And upload evidence that you have completed Exercise03\n13. Click \"Prepare an answer\" on NEO\n14. Click the \"<>\" (Source code) button.\n15. Paste by pressing CTRL + V\n16. Click \"Save and submit for grading\"\n17. If you made changes to the code in Giffer, then Copy the code from Giffer and paste it into the Arduino and re-save it as: YourInitials_Exercise03 - in your Documents/Arduino/Exercises Folder."}
