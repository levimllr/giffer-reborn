Copy the program from Starting Point Exercise18 into the Arduino IDE. \n  2. Compile and upload this program to the Arduino and verify that LED 2 blinks on and off four times with a 200ms delay between each, then LED 3 blinks on and off four times with a 200ms delay between each, then the program pauses for 4 seconds and the whole thing starts over again….\n  3. Modify the program so that it blinks LED 2 four times, then it blinks LED 3 four times, then it blinks LED 4 four times waits four seconds THEN - all LEDS are off for four seconds then everything starts over again.\n  4. Modify the program so that it blinks LED 2 two times, then blinks LED 3 three times, then blinks LED 4 four times THEN - all LEDS are off for four seconds then everything starts over again.\n  5. Save the completed sketch as YourInitials_Exercise18 in: Documents – Arduino – Exercises\n  6. Copy the code into the [Giffer](http://dpengineering.github.io/giffer-reborn/) website\n  7. Enter your  ** _name_**  and  ** _exercise number._**\n  8. Select the  ** _Run and Grade_** button.\n  9. Look at the resulting Output image and make sure it is correct ( **Correct**  at lower part of image)\n  10. If it is Correct -  use the ** **Copy Page**  button to copy the evidence that you have correctly completed the exercise to clipboard.\n  11. Go to  **CL 10.3.18 Upload Completed Exercise18** :  And upload evidence that you have completed Exercise18\n  12. **Click \" **Prepare an answer** \" on NEO\n  13. Click the \" **< >**\" ( _Source code_ ) button.\n  14. Paste by pressing **CTRL + V**\n  15. **Click** \" ** _Save and submit for grading_** \"\n  16. If you made changes to the code in Giffer, then Copy the code from Giffer and paste it into the Arduino and re-save it as:  _YourInitials_Exercise18 -_ in your  _Documents/Arduino/Exercises_  Folder."}
