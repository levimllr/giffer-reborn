Compile and upload this program to the Arduino and verify that LED 2 lights up.\n2.\tExercise: Remove the; from the end of the line: digitalWrite(2, HIGH);\n3.\t Try to compile and upload the program. You should get a compiler error.\n4.\tLook at the compiler error (red cryptic message at bottom of screen) – this it what happens when we are missing a semi-colon\n5.\tFix the program so it compiles (put the ; back in at the end of digitalWrite(2, HIGH);\n6.\tVerify that there is no compiler error and that LED 2 lights up.\n7.\tModify the program so the Arduino Turns on LEDs 2 and 3.\n8.\tModify the program so the Arduino Turns on LEDs 2, 3 and 4.\n9.\tSave the completed sketch as YourInitials_Exercise02 in: Documents – Arduino – Exercises\n10.\tCreate a file that contains your animated gif and source code. Call it  YourInitials_Exercise02"}
