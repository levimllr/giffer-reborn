Copy the program from Starting Point Exercise09 into the Arduino IDE. \n2. Compile and upload this program to the Arduino and verify that LED 2 Blinks on and off 4 times with a delay of 400 milliseconds and then LED 3 Blinks on and off 4 times with a delay of 400 milliseconds THEN - all LEDS are off for four seconds then everything starts over again.\n3. Modify the program so that it blinks LED 2 four times, then it blinks LED 3 four times, then it blinks LED 4 four times waits four seconds THEN - all LEDS are off for four seconds then everything starts over again.\n4. Modify the program so that it blinks LED 2 two times, then blinks LED 3 three times, then blinks LED 4 four times THEN - all LEDS are off for 8 seconds then everything starts over again.\n5. Save the completed sketch as YourInitials_Exercise09 in: Documents – Arduino – Exercises\n6. Copy the code into the Giffer website\n7. Enter your name and exercise number.\n8. Select the Run and Grade button.\n9. Look at the resulting Output image and make sure it is correct (Correct at lower part of image)\n10. If it is Correct - use theCopy Page button to copy the evidence that you have correctly completed the exercise to clipboard.\n11. Go to CL 10.3.09 Upload Completed Exercise09: And upload evidence that you have completed Exercise09\n12. Click \"Prepare an answer\" on NEO\n13. Click the \"<>\" (Source code) button.\n14. Paste by pressing CTRL + V\n15. Click \"Save and submit for grading\"\n16. If you made changes to the code in Giffer, then Copy the code from Giffer and paste it into the Arduino and re-save it as: YourInitials_Exercise09 - in your Documents/Arduino/Exercises Folder."}
