54:** Learning how to use the Knob / Potentiometer on the Light\nSculpture board\n\n\n\n**NEW:** Reading the On / Off state of the knob / potentiometer on the Light\nSculpture board\n\n\n\n**DESCRIPTION:**\n\n\n\nBy now you’re probably wondering what that knob on the board is for. That’s\ncalled a potentiometer. You turn it, and the Arduino can read what position it\nis in. We’d like to change our program’s behavior based on what the\npotentiometer is doing. For this, we need to make some decisions. Perfect job\nfor if/else statements.\n\n\n\nFirst, we need to know what pins the knob / potentiometer can change. The\npotentiometer is connectected to two pins on the arduino - similarly to how\nthe LED’s are connected to pins on the Arduino. However - with the pins\nconnected to the potentiometer the pins are inputs on the Arduino as opposed\nto the LED’s which are outputs on the Arduino.\n\n\n\n**Input / Output pins - what’s the difference?**\n\n\n\n**Output pins** , we have been using them to turn on and off the LEDs in our\nlight sculpture board - **Send information to the light sculpture board.**\n\n\n\n**Input pins** ,  we will be using them to get information from the light\nsculpture board. **Getting information from the user using the light sculpture\nboard.**\n\n\n\nFor this first exercise using the potentiometer, we will only be focusing on\nthe first pin connected to the potentiometer. Pin 18 on the Arduino is\nconnected to the potentiometer like an ON / OFF switch. If you rotate the Knob\nfrom all the way clockwise to all the way counterclockwise you will hear a\nclick at the end of its counterclockwise rotation. This click is connecting\nPin 18 on the Arduino to ground. If we rotate the Knob clockwise you will the\nclick again and that means that Pin 18 is no longer connected to ground.\n\n\n\nWhen Pin 18 is connected to ground - if we read its value from the Arduino Pin\n18 = 0.\n\n\n\nWhen Pin 18 is not connected to ground - if we read its value from the Arduino\nPin 18 = 1.\n\n\n\nSecond, we need to know how to read in a value from the potentiometer.\nFortunately, it’s easier than you think. This line does it all:\n\n\n\nint pin18 = digitalRead(18);\n\n\n\ndigitalRead() is a function that can read values from pins on the Arduino.\nJust like pinMode() or digitalWrite(), digitalRead() needs a pin to use.\n\n\n\nint pin18 = digitalRead(18); // This line sets the variable “pin18” equal to\nthe state pin 18 is in.\n\n\n\nIn summary:\n\n\n\nWhen the knob is rotated all the way counterclockwise, Pin 18 is connected to\nground. If we read its value from the Arduino Pin 18 = 0. If we run the next\nline of code with the knob in this state, the variable pin18 will be equal to\n0.\n\npin18 = digitalRead(18);\n\n\n\nWhen the knob is rotated in any other state other than all the way\ncounterclockwise, Pin 18 is connected to five volts. If we read its value from\nthe Arduino Pin 18 = 1. If we run the next line of code with the knob in this\nstate, the variable pin18 will be equal to 1.\n\npin18 = digitalRead(18);\n\n  \n  \n\n**EXAMPLE:**\n\n\n\nvoid setup()\n\n{\n\n Serial.begin(9600); // Setup the serial port speed\n\n pinMode(18, INPUT);\n\n}\n\n\n\nvoid loop()\n\n{\n\n int pin18 = 0;     // variable to store the value of pin 18\n\n pin18 = digitalRead(18); // read the input pin either HIGH or LOW\n\n\n\n if (pin18 == 0)\n\n {\n\n   Serial.println(\"Pin 18 is equal to zero\");\n\n }\n\n if (pin18 == 1)\n\n {\n\n   Serial.println(\"Pin 18 is equal to one\");\n\n }\n\n delay(500);\n\n}\n\n\n\nIf we run this code on a Arduino with a light sculpture connected and look at\nthe serial output we will see the output change based on the position of the\nknob.\n\n\n\n**Giffer and the Potentiometer**\n\nWe can use Giffer to read the state of the potentiometer, but first you have\nto setup Giffer to give it a timeline of the values of the potentiometer. This\ncan be done by clicking on the **Configure Board** tab at upper right on the\ngiffer page. Feel free to check it out now. Note - that to make giffer\ninterpret a pin as being one (1) - you need to give it a value of 1023. This\nisn’t a bug - rather it allows us to use giffer to interpret analog pins as\nwell - we will go over that further in the next exercise.\n\n\n\nFor exercises 54 - 56, giffer will be setup with specific timelines for the\ninputs that are connected to the potentiometer, which I will describe in the\nActivity directions.\n\n\n\n**_ACTIVITIES:_**\n\n\n\n  1. Copy the program from Starting Point Exercise 54 into the Arduino IDE\n  2. Compile and upload this program and verify that the output from the serial port is Hello World! then a new line, then it reads the  value of pin 18, and serial.prints the result, then serial.prints Good Bye World! a pause of 10 ms and the whole thing starts over again….\n  3. Change the program so it prints:\n    1. Hello World! then a new line, \n    2. Then it reads the  value of pin 18, and serial.prints the result\n    3. If pin 18 is **Zero** \\- then **turn off** pins 2-15 with no delay\n    4. If pin 18 is **One** \\- then **turn on** pins 2-15 with no delay\n    5. This repeats 100 times\n    6. then prints Good Bye World!! then a new line, then the program pauses for 10ms seconds and the whole thing starts over again….\n  4. It is recommended that you test your program first on the Arduino with the light sculpture board attached so you can watch the serial output while you turn the potentiometer.\n  5. However - if you don’t have a Arduino with a light sculpture board attached - giffer for this exercise is programed with the following timeline of the values for pin 18\n    1.    0ms Pin 18 = 0\n    2. 250ms Pin 18 = 1\n    3. 500ms Pin 18 = 0\n    4. 750ms Pin 18 = 1\n  6. Save the completed sketch as YourInitials_Exercise54 in: Documents – Arduino – Exercises\n  7. Copy the code into the Giffer website\n  8. Enter your name and exercise number.\n  9. Select the Run and Grade button.\n  10. Look at the resulting Output image and make sure it is correct (Correct at lower part of image)\n  11. If it is Correct - use the Copy Page button to copy the evidence that you have correctly completed the exercise to clipboard.\n  12. Go to CL 10.4.24 Upload Completed Exercise54: And upload evidence that you have completed Exercise54\n  13. Click \"Prepare an answer\" on NEO\n  14. Click the \"<>\" (Source code) button.\n  15. Paste by pressing CTRL + V\n  16. Click \"Save and submit for grading\"\n  17. If you made changes to the code in Giffer, then Copy the code from Giffer and paste it into the Arduino and re-save it as: YourInitials_Exercise54 - in your Documents/Arduino/Exercises Folder.\n"}
