Have watched the second video on functions - Arduino Functions 2\n  2. Have watched the third video on functions - Arduino Functions 3\n\n\n\n**NEW:** **Using parameters in our function definitions;**\n\n\n\n**EXAMPLE:**\n\n\n\nvoid blink2Once(int t)  \n{  \n digitalWrite(2, HIGH);  \n delay(t);  \n digitalWrite(2, LOW);  \n delay(t);  \n}\n\n\n\nIn this example the function blink2Once is expecting an argument (in this case\nan integer) to be passed to it when you call it. If we look at this code it,\nwe can see that It is using this argument to determine the delay time.\n\n  \n**_ACTIVITIES:_**\n\n\n\n  1. Copy the program from Starting Point Exercise32 into the Arduino IDE\n  2. Compile and upload this program and verify that LED 2 blinks on and off five times with a 100ms delay between each, then the program pauses for 4 seconds and the whole thing starts over again….\n  3. Rename the function from  blink to blink2Once\n  4. Make an new function named blink3Once that blinks LED 3 instead of LED 2\n  5. Modify loop() so that blink2Once(200) and blink3Once(200) are called one time each.\n  6. Verify that LED 2 blinks on and of with a 200ms delay, then LED 3 blinks on and of with a 200ms delay, this repeats 5 times then the program pauses for 4 seconds and the whole thing starts over again.\n  7. Save the completed sketch as YourInitials_Exercise32 in: Documents – Arduino – Exercises\n  8. Copy the code into the Giffer website\n  9. Enter your name and exercise number.\n  10. Select the Run and Grade button.\n  11. Look at the resulting Output image and make sure it is correct (Correct at lower part of image)\n  12. If it is Correct - use the Copy Page button to copy the evidence that you have correctly completed the exercise to clipboard.\n  13. Go to CL 10.4.02 Upload Completed Exercise32: And upload evidence that you have completed Exercise32\n  14. Click \"Prepare an answer\" on NEO\n  15. Click the \"<>\" (Source code) button.\n  16. Paste by pressing CTRL + V\n  17. Click \"Save and submit for grading\"\n  18. If you made changes to the code in Giffer, then Copy the code from Giffer and paste it into the Arduino and re-save it as: YourInitials_Exercise32 - in your Documents/Arduino/Exercises Folder."}
