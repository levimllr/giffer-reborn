Have watched the fourth video on functions - Arduino Functions 4\n\n\n\n**NEW:** **Using two arguments in our function definitions;**\n\n\n\n**EXAMPLE:**\n\n\n\nvoid blinkOnce(int t, int n)  \n{  \n digitalWrite(n, HIGH);  \n delay(t);  \n digitalWrite(n, LOW);  \n delay(t);  \n}\n\n\n\nIn this example the function blinkOnce is expecting two arguments. In this\ncase it is expecting an integer **t** , that will be used to determine the\ndelay time, and an integer **n** which will be used to determine the LED to\nblink on and off.  \n  \n\n**_ACTIVITIES:_**\n\n\n\n  1. Copy the program from Starting Point Exercise33 into the Arduino IDE\n  2. Compile and upload this program and verify that LED 2 blinks on and off, then LED 3 then blinks on and off, then LED 4 blinks on and off, this entire sequence repeats five times with a 100ms delay between each, then the program pauses for 4 seconds and the whole thing starts over again….\n  3. Modify the blinkOnce function calls so that the LEDs blink in the order 4, 2, 3 then this entire sequence repeats five times with a 100ms delay between each, then the program pauses for 4 seconds and the whole thing starts over again….\n  4. Save the completed sketch as YourInitials_Exercise33 in: Documents – Arduino – Exercises\n  5. Copy the code into the Giffer website\n  6. Enter your name and exercise number.\n  7. Select the Run and Grade button.\n  8. Look at the resulting Output image and make sure it is correct (Correct at lower part of image)\n  9. If it is Correct - use the Copy Page button to copy the evidence that you have correctly completed the exercise to clipboard.\n  10. Go to CL 10.4.03 Upload Completed Exercise33: And upload evidence that you have completed Exercise33\n  11. Click \"Prepare an answer\" on NEO\n  12. Click the \"<>\" (Source code) button.\n  13. Paste by pressing CTRL + V\n  14. Click \"Save and submit for grading\"\n  15. If you made changes to the code in Giffer, then Copy the code from Giffer and paste it into the Arduino and re-save it as: YourInitials_Exercise33 - in your Documents/Arduino/Exercises Folder."}
