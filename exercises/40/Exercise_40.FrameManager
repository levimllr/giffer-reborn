When you finish this exercise there will be one custom function in loop(), **sequenceLEDsShowingAllColors.**\n  2. Copy the program from Starting Point Exercise40 into the Arduino IDE\n  3. Create  a new function named **sequenceLEDsShowingAllColors** that uses three parameters to control the delay **onTime** , the delay **offTime** and **repeatCount** the number of times a for loop repeats in the function. This Function will slowly show all the colors.  First turn on all the yellows(15, 14), then turn them off. Next turn on all the reds(2, 4, 6, 8), then turn them off.  Now show the oranges(9, 10, 11), followed by the greens(3, 5, 7) and finally the blues(  \n12, 13).\n\n  4. You should be able to look at the image on giffer to determine the correct onTime and offTime and repeatCount\n  5. loop() happens once, then there will be a 3 second delay after which the whole thing starts over again.\n  6. Save the completed sketch as YourInitials_Exercise40 in: Documents – Arduino – Exercises\n  7. Copy the code into the Giffer website\n  8. Enter your name and exercise number.\n  9. Select the Run and Grade button.\n  10. Look at the resulting Output image and make sure it is correct (Correct at lower part of image)\n  11. If it is Correct - use the Copy Page button to copy the evidence that you have correctly completed the exercise to clipboard.\n  12. Go to CL 10.4.10 Upload Completed Exercise40: And upload evidence that you have completed Exercise40\n  13. Click \"Prepare an answer\" on NEO\n  14. Click the \"<>\" (Source code) button.\n  15. Paste by pressing CTRL + V\n  16. Click \"Save and submit for grading\"\n  17. If you made changes to the code in Giffer, then Copy the code from Giffer and paste it into the Arduino and re-save it as: YourInitials_Exercise40 - in your Documents/Arduino/Exercises Folder."}
