Copy the program from Starting Point Exercise04 into the Arduino IDE. \n2. Compile and upload this program to the Arduino and verify that LED 2 turns on for 1/2 second ahd then OFF for 5 seconds and repeats over and over .....\n3. Modify the program so that LED 2 turns ON for a 1/2 second, then OFF for a 1/2 second THEN LED 2 turns ON for a 1/2 second, then OFF for a 1/2 second (OR BLINKS TWICE) and THEN OFF for 5 seconds and repeats BLINKING in this pattern over and over……\n4. Modify the program so that LED 2 BLINKS ON and OFF THREE times (going ON for 1/2 second, then OFF for a 1/2 second). After the third BLINK  LED2 is OFF for 5 seconds and repeats BLINKING in this pattern over and over…...\n5. Modify the program so that LED 3 BLINKS ON and OFF THREE times like step 3 above.\n6. Save the completed sketch as YourInitials_Exercise04 in: Documents – Arduino – Exercises\n7. Copy the code into the Giffer website\n8. Enter your name and exercise number.\n9. Select the Run and Grade button.\n10. Look at the resulting Output image and make sure it is correct (Correct at lower part of image)\n11. If it is Correct -  use the Copy Page button to copy the evidence that you have correctly completed the exercise to clipboard.\n12. Go to CL 10.3.04 Upload Completed Exercise04:  And upload evidence that you have completed Exercise04\n13. Click \"Prepare an answer\" on NEO\n14. Click the \"<>\" (Source code) button.\n15. Paste by pressing CTRL + V\n16. Click \"Save and submit for grading\"\n17. If you made changes to the code in Giffer, then Copy the code from Giffer and paste it into the Arduino and re-save it as: YourInitials_Exercise04 - in your Documents/Arduino/Exercises Folder."}
