Have watched the first video on arrays - Arduino Tutorial 6 -- Basic Arrays\n  2. Have read and understand the handout - DPEA - Arrays in Arduino\n\n**NEW:** **Arrays in the Arduino programming environment;**\n\n**DESCRIPTION: An array is a collection of variables that are accessed /\nreferenced with an index number. Essentially an array is just a way to store a\nlist on numbers. Because we can put values in this list in any order, using\narrays to program a light sculpture becomes really useful.**\n\n\n\n**Some vocabulary:**\n\n**Array:** A list of things. For now it will typically be a list of integers\n\n**Elements:** The actual values stored in the list\n\n**Number of elements:** count up how many integers in the list\n\n**Index:** A way to reference an element in the array (a way to list a number\nin the list)\n\n\n\n**EXAMPLE:**\n\n\n\n// Creates an array of **5** integers / elements and assigns values to those\nintegers\n\n\n\nint myArray[ **5** ] = {4, 7, 2, 8, 3};    // {4, 7, 2, 8, 3 } <\\- array\nvalues\n\n\n\nArrays are _zero-indexed_ , so the first element of the array is at index **0\nnot index 1**\n\nmyArray;\n\n// { 4, 7, 2, 8, 3 } <\\- array values\n\n// [ 0  1 2 3 4 ] <\\- index number\n\n\n\nTo access a element in an array - Do the following\n\nmyArray[0] = 4;   // This statement allows us to access the first element of\nthe array\n\n// { 4, 7, 2, 8, 3 } <\\- array values\n\n// [ 0  1 2 3 4 ] <\\- index number\n\n\n\nmyArray[4] = 3;  // This statement allows us to access the fourth element of\nthe array\n\n// { 4, 7, 2, 8, 3 } <\\- array values\n\n// [ 0  1 2 3 4 ] <\\- index number\n\n\n\n**EXAMPLE:**\n\n\n\nvoid loop()\n\n{\n\n int myFirstArray[7] = {\n\n   2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14  }; // creates an array of 7 integers / elements and\ninitializes / assigns values to those integers\n\n int index;\n\n // Blinks LED's in the order defined by the array\n\n for(index = 0; index <= 6; index++)\n\n {\n\n   digitalWrite(myFirstArray[index], HIGH);\n\n   delay(150);\n\n   digitalWrite(myFirstArray[index], LOW);\n\n }\n\n delay(4000);\n\n}\n\n\n\n**_ACTIVITIES:_**\n\n\n\n  1. Copy the program from Starting Point Exercise42 into the Arduino IDE\n  2. Compile and upload this program and verify that all the even LED’s blink on and off with a 150ms delay between each, then the program pauses for 4 seconds and the whole thing starts over again….\n  3. Change the values stored in the array so that all the odd LED’s blink on and off with a 150ms delay between each, then the program pauses for 4 seconds and the whole thing starts over again….\n  4. Save the completed sketch as YourInitials_Exercise42 in: Documents – Arduino – Exercises\n  5. Copy the code into the Giffer website\n  6. Enter your name and exercise number.\n  7. Select the Run and Grade button.\n  8. Look at the resulting Output image and make sure it is correct (Correct at lower part of image)\n  9. If it is Correct - use the Copy Page button to copy the evidence that you have correctly completed the exercise to clipboard.\n  10. Go to CL 10.4.12 Upload Completed Exercise42: And upload evidence that you have completed Exercise42\n  11. Click \"Prepare an answer\" on NEO\n  12. Click the \"<>\" (Source code) button.\n  13. Paste by pressing CTRL + V\n  14. Click \"Save and submit for grading\"\n  15. If you made changes to the code in Giffer, then Copy the code from Giffer and paste it into the Arduino and re-save it as: YourInitials_Exercise42 - in your Documents/Arduino/Exercises Folder."}
