Copy the program from Starting Point Exercise15 into the Arduino IDE. \n  2. Compile and upload this program to the Arduino and verify that LED’s 2 through 15 blink on and off in order with a 200ms delay between each, then the program pauses for 4 seconds and the whole thing starts over again….\n  3. Create another variable called otherLedNum.\n  4. Create another variable otherLedNum = ledNumber +7.\n  5. Modify the while loop to blink LEDs 2 – 8 on / off.\n  6. Now modify the while loop to turn on LED 2 & 9 at the same time.\n  7. Hint - Use something like the following two commands in order:\n    * digitalWrite(ledNumber, HIGH); \n    * digitalWrite(otherLedNum, HIGH);\n  8. Save the completed sketch as YourInitials_Exercise15 in: Documents – Arduino – Exercises\n  9. Copy the code into the [Giffer](http://dpengineering.github.io/giffer-reborn/) website\n  10. Enter your  ** _name_**  and  ** _exercise number._**\n  11. Select the  ** _Run and Grade_** button.\n  12. Look at the resulting Output image and make sure it is correct ( **Correct**  at lower part of image)\n  13. If it is Correct -  use the ** **Copy Page**  button to copy the evidence that you have correctly completed the exercise to clipboard.\n  14. Go to  **CL 10.3.15 Upload Completed Exercise15** :  And upload evidence that you have completed Exercise15\n  15. **Click \" **Prepare an answer** \" on NEO\n  16. Click the \" **< >**\" ( _Source code_ ) button.\n  17. Paste by pressing **CTRL + V**\n  18. **Click** \" ** _Save and submit for grading_** \"\n  19. If you made changes to the code in Giffer, then Copy the code from Giffer and paste it into the Arduino and re-save it as:  _YourInitials_Exercise15 -_ in your  _Documents/Arduino/Exercises_  Folder."}
