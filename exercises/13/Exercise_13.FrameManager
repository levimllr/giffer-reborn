Copy the program from Starting Point Exercise13 into the Arduino IDE. \n  2. Compile and upload this program to the Arduino and verify that LED’s 2 through 15 blink on and off in order with a 200ms delay between each, then the program pauses for 4 seconds and the whole thing starts over again….\n  3. Modify the program so that only LED’s 2 through 8 blink on and off, then LED’s 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 blink on and off.\n  4. Save the completed sketch as YourInitials_Exercise13 in: Documents – Arduino – Exercises\n  5. Copy the code into the [Giffer](http://dpengineering.github.io/giffer-reborn/) website\n  6. Enter your  ** _name_**  and  ** _exercise number._**\n  7. Select the  ** _Run and Grade_** button.\n  8. Look at the resulting Output image and make sure it is correct ( **Correct**  at lower part of image)\n  9. If it is Correct -  use the ** **Copy Page**  button to copy the evidence that you have correctly completed the exercise to clipboard.\n  10. Go to  **CL 10.3.13 Upload Completed Exercise13** :  And upload evidence that you have completed Exercise13\n  11. **Click \" **Prepare an answer** \" on NEO\n  12. Click the \" **< >**\" ( _Source code_ ) button.\n  13. Paste by pressing **CTRL + V**\n  14. **Click** \" ** _Save and submit for grading_** \"\n  15. If you made changes to the code in Giffer, then Copy the code from Giffer and paste it into the Arduino and re-save it as:  _YourInitials_Exercise13 -_ in your  _Documents/Arduino/Exercises_  Folder."}
