Copy the program from Starting Point Exercise43 into the Arduino IDE\n  2. Compile and upload this program and verify that all the even LED’s blink on and off with a 150ms delay between each, then the program pauses for 4 seconds and the whole thing starts over again….\n  3. Change the program so that the array stores 14 values. Now use this array to blink on / off  LED’s 2 - 15 in order. The LED’s blink on and off with a 150ms delay between each, then the program pauses for 4 seconds and the whole thing starts over again….\n  4. Save the completed sketch as YourInitials_Exercise43 in: Documents – Arduino – Exercises\n  5. Copy the code into the Giffer website\n  6. Enter your name and exercise number.\n  7. Select the Run and Grade button.\n  8. Look at the resulting Output image and make sure it is correct (Correct at lower part of image)\n  9. If it is Correct - use the Copy Page button to copy the evidence that you have correctly completed the exercise to clipboard.\n  10. Go to CL 10.4.13 Upload Completed Exercise43: And upload evidence that you have completed Exercise43\n  11. Click \"Prepare an answer\" on NEO\n  12. Click the \"<>\" (Source code) button.\n  13. Paste by pressing CTRL + V\n  14. Click \"Save and submit for grading\"\n  15. If you made changes to the code in Giffer, then Copy the code from Giffer and paste it into the Arduino and re-save it as: YourInitials_Exercise43 - in your Documents/Arduino/Exercises Folder."}
